## Mask Settings

The masks caracteristics depend on the chosen mask type.

Availaible mask patterns :

- **slit** : only one column of the mask is open, thus generating a spectral gradient type filter.

- **random** : random noise pattern with a normal law

- **blue noise** : random noise pattern with boosted high frequencies
